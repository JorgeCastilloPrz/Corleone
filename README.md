Corleone
========

<img alt="Corleone Java APT" src="./art/corleone.png" />

Java annotation processor used to manage background tasks through the following annotations:

* ```@Job```: Used on top of your background task classes, it can contain multiple annotations of type @Rule.
* ```@Rule```: Every job task can have multiple contexts defined to allow different instances of the same job running on different contexts.
Each context ```@Rule``` has an optional field for declaring a previous job task (for job concatenation).
* ```@Param```: Used on job class attribute fields to allow param injection through autogenerated param binders. As the responsibily of building job instances
will reside on the library, job class constructors will not be allowed. Params will find their corresponding runtime values when they get instantiated by Corleone.
Keep reading to know how to provide them.
* ```@Execution```: Used to annotate a job method. ```@Execution``` method will be the one autoexecuted to do the job.

Dependencies
------------

* [AutoService][dependencies-1]: One of the providers of Google auto library. A metadata/config generator to avoid typical ServiceLoader manual setup.
* [JavaPoet][dependencies-2]: A Square's java source file generation library. It's the successor of JavaWriter.

Testing
-------

* [Compile-testing][testing-libs-1]: Google testing framework to allow testing java sources @ javac compile time.
* [Truth][testing-libs-2]: Google library to "humanize" language of JUnit testing assertions.
* [JUnit][testing-libs-3]: Base for all the project unit tests.
