Corleone (Not finished) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JorgeCastilloPrz/Corleone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JorgeCastilloPrz/Corleone)
=======================

![Corleone image](/art/corleone.png)

Java annotation processor library used to dispatch and concatenate background tasks in a decoupled way through a simple syntax.

Usage
=====

The use of the library is pretty simple. First of all, you will need to know about the available annotations.

Annotations
-----------

* `@Job`: Used on top of your background task classes, it can contain multiple annotations of type `@Rule`.
* `@Rule`: Every job can have multiple Rules. A `@Rule` is used to define an execution context for the job, and an optional `previousJob` class (For concatenation).
* `@Param`: Used on job class attribute fields to allow param injection through autogenerated param binders. As the responsibily of building job instances
will reside on the library, job class constructors will not be allowed. Params will satisfy their corresponding runtime values when the job gets instantiated by Corleone.
Keep reading to know how to provide them.
* `@Execution`: Used to annotate a job method. Only one method can be flagged as the `@Execution` method for a class. This will be the method containning the
background logic, as it will be the one executed automatically by Corleone at the right moment.

Jobs
----

Corleone loves to delegate all the dirty jobs on his beloved family members to avoid worries. `@Job` syntax will be like:
```java
@Job({
    @Rule(context = "ObtainGames", previousJob = CheckNetworkConnection.class)
})
public class GetGamesFromService {

    @Param("RestRepo") GameRepository restGameRepository;
    @Param("PageNum") int pageNumber;
    @Param("RestCallback") Callback callback;

    @Execution
    public void run() {
        try {
            List<Game> games = gameRepository.obtainGamesByPage(pageNumber);
            notifyGamesLoaded(games);
        }
        catch (ObtainGamesException exception) {
            notifyPetitionError(exception.getMessage());
        }
    }

    private void notifyGamesLoaded(final List<Game> games) {
      callback.onGamePageLoaded(games);
      Corleone.context("ObtainGames").provideParam("games", games);
      Corleone.context("ObtainGames").keepGoing();
    }

    private void notifyPetitionError(final String message) {
      callback.onGettingGamesError(message);
    }
}
```

You can declare as many jobs as you want and link them by `@Rule` contexts.

Job dispatch
---------------

To start the job chain dispatch, this will be your code:

```java
Corleone.context("ObtainGames").dispatchJobs();
```

Param providing
---------------

As you can see in the previous code snippet, `@Job` params are given by some kind of injection technique. You don't pass them as method or constructor arguments,
 but provide them by two different ways. The first one is into the `@Job` dispatch call arguments.
 
```java
JobParams jobParams = new JobParams()
		.append("ConnectivityManager", connectivityManager);
		.append("RestRepo", restGameRepository)
		.append("PersistenceRepo", persistenceGameRepository)
 		.append("PageNum", pageNumber)
		.append("RestCallback", getRestGameQueryCallback())
		.append("PersistenceCallback", getPersistenceGameQueryCallback());

Corleone.context("ObtainGames").dispatchJobs(jobParams);
```

This example shows how to provide params for the whole `@Job` context execution. All the jobs linked to that context will be able to use them. This is the right 
way to provide params just before starting the job chain execution. The `append()` method **requires a param qualifier and a param value**.

The second way available is being used in the `GetGamesFromService` job code snippet:

```java
Corleone.context("ObtainGames").provideParam("MyParamQualifier", paramValue);
```

Params can be added by `provideParam()` method too. This method can be used to provide params from one `@Job` to another that will be executed later on. Sometimes 
we need to use the output results from one task as the input ones for a new one. This would be the right way to do so.

Dependencies
------------
