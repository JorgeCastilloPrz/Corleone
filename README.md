Corleone
========

![Corleone image](/art/corleone.png)

Java annotation processor library used to dispatch and concatenate background tasks in a decoupled way through a simple syntax.

Usage
=====

The use of the library is pretty simple. First of all, you will need to know about the available annotations.

Annotations
-----------

* `@Job`: Used on top of your background task classes, it can contain multiple annotations of type `@Rule`.
* `@Rule`: Every job can have multiple Rules. A `@Rule` is used to define an execution context for the job, and an optional `previousJob` class (For concatenation).
* `@Param`: Used on job class attribute fields to allow param injection through autogenerated param binders. As the responsibily of building job instances
will reside on the library, job class constructors will not be allowed. Params will satisfy their corresponding runtime values when the job gets instantiated by Corleone.
Keep reading to know how to provide them.
* `@Execution`: Used to annotate a job method. Only one method can be flagged as the `@Execution` method for a class. This will be the method containning the
background logic, as it will be the one executed automatically by Corleone at the right moment.

Jobs
----

Corleone loves to delegate all the dirty jobs on his beloved family members to avoid worries. `@Job` syntax will be like:
```java
@Job({
    @Rule(context = "ObtainGames", previousJob = CheckNetworkConnection.class)
})
public class GetGamesFromService {

    @Param("RestRepo") GameRepository restGameRepository;
    @Param("PageNum") int pageNumber;
    @Param("RestCallback") Callback callback;
    @Param("MainThread") MainThread mainThread;

    @Execution
    public void run() {
        try {
            List<Game> games = gameRepository.obtainGamesByPage(pageNumber);
            notifyGamesLoaded(games);
        }
        catch (ObtainGamesException exception) {
            notifyPetitionError(exception.getMessage());
        }
    }

    private void notifyGamesLoaded(final List<Game> games) {
      mainThread.post(new Runnable() {
         @Override
         public void run() {
            callback.onGamePageLoaded(games);
         }
      });
      Corleone.context("ObtainGames").provideParam("games", games);
      Corleone.keepGoing();
    }

    private void notifyPetitionError(final String message) {
      mainThread.post(new Runnable() {
         @Override
         public void run() {
            callback.onGettingGamesError(message);
         }
      });
    }
}
```

Param providing
---------------

As you can see in the previous code snippet, `@Job` params are given by some kind of injection technique. You don't pass them as method or constructor arguments,
 but provide them by two different decoupled ways. The first one is into the `@Job` dispatch call arguments.
```java
JobParams jobParams = new JobParams()
		.append("ConnectivityManager", connectivityManager);
		.append("RestRepo", restGameRepository)
		.append("PersistenceRepo", persistenceGameRepository)
 		.append("PageNum", pageNumber)
		.append("RestCallback", getRestGameQueryCallback())
		.append("PersistenceCallback", getPersistenceGameQueryCallback())
		.append("MainThread", mainThread);

	Corleone.with("ObtainGames").dispatchJobs(jobParams);
```
This example shows how to provide params for the whole `@Job` context execution. All the jobs linked to that context will be able to use them. This is the right 
way to provide params just before starting the job chain execution. The `append()` method **requires a param qualifier** and a param value.
The second way available is being used in the `GetGamesFromService` code snippet. ```java Corleone.context("ObtainGames").provideParam("MyParamQualifier", paramValue);```.
As you can see, params can be provided by `provideParam()` method too, which requires a **param qualifier** and a param value too. This method can be used to 
provide params from one `@Job` to a following `@Job` that will be executed later on.

Dependencies
------------

* [AutoService][dependencies-1]: One of the providers of Google auto library. A metadata/config generator to avoid typical ServiceLoader manual setup.

Testing
-------

* [Compile-testing][testing-libs-1]: Google testing framework to allow testing java sources @ javac compile time.
* [Truth][testing-libs-2]: Google library to "humanize" language of JUnit testing assertions.
* [JUnit][testing-libs-3]: Base for all the project unit tests.
